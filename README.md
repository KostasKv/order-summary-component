## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind background image](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-image) - Documentation for using background images with Tailwind CSS.
- [Tailwind background repeat](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-repeat) - Turning off background repeat is what made the background look as it is in the design. Took a little bit of fiddling around until I came across this.
